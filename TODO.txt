browser
==================================
- show "please wait" when the private key is being unlocked

content
==================================
- add timeout to expire messages in the DOM
- on install the content script should prompt the tab to get reloaded, so it takes the new code
- think about a more general SLP url scheme, so it can scale with other urls

background
==================================
- decide what to do with the cached public key link

settings
====================================
- do not require name when creating a key
- need to import and export secret key and address book


installation
====================================


Development
====================================
- Add a special type for Magic URL
- Use port to communicate from content to background (should be faster). At least to decrypt the links;
- Use chrome.i18n to implement i18n

Testing
===================================
Rethink the name and content of the message that gets sent when the encoding is over
