browser
==================================
- show "please wait" when the private key is being unlocked
- do not allow anything unless there is an active editable 
- when there is no text in the editable, show "No text entered" with a link "Add text" that shows the text box. This way the focus will be on "Share pub key" button
- if the key looked up has multiple user ids, they all show in the drowpdown as the primary id
- add message expiration. Expire messages.
- BUG: backspace deletes a bead with the last letter of the text

content
==================================

background
==================================
- decide what to do with the cached public key link

settings
====================================
- do not require name when creating a key
- need to import and export secret key and address book


installation
====================================


API
====================================
- Reject payload bigger than X bytes (so idiots don't overload your storage)


Development
====================================
- Use port to communicate from content to background (should be faster). At least to decrypt the links;
- Use chrome.i18n to implement i18n

Testing
===================================
Send a browser message when the content script is done decoding. This way you can run tests on that message.
