browser
==================================

content
==================================

background
==================================
- cache the public key link in the settings and reuse it

settings
====================================
- do not require name when creating a key
- need to import and export secret key and address book


installation
====================================


API
====================================
- Reject payload bigger than X bytes (so idiots don't overload your storage)


Development
====================================
- The background page reports an error when there is a public key in the DOM (can'r reproduce?)
- Use port to communicate from content to background (should be faster). At least to decrypt the links;
- Use chrome.i18n to implement i18n
