==================================
[Public Keys]
- Order keys by most used and show the last ones used.

[Private Key]
- Send private key as a link. Save the link in localStore, so it can be reused next time.

[My Key]
- Disable if no text area is active
- Add more text



content
==================================
- Provide a key shortcut to auto-encrypt current text with the last public key (or combination of public keys).
- Unify the way [PGP MESSAGE:1234] is displayed. Maybe move it in a method in messageStore
- Recognize public key links and transform them into a clickable item. When clicked, import into the address book and show an info notif.
- Once a text area has been encrypted, mark it as such, so it can not be double-encrypted.
- Once the password is locked, restore all tabs' decrypted texts back to links

background
==================================
- cache the public key link in the settings and reuse it
