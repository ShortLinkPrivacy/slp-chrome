browser
==================================
- Order keys by most used and show the last ones used.

content
==================================
- Provide a key shortcut to auto-encrypt current text with the last public key (or combination of public keys).
- Expand to other elements, not just TEXTAREA (gmail)

background
==================================
- cache the public key link in the settings and reuse it

settings
====================================
- do not require name when creating a key


installation
====================================
- Lead the user to create/import a private key right after the extension has been installed.


API
====================================
- Reject payload bigger than X bytes (so idiots don't overload your storage)


Development
====================================
- The background page reports an error when there is a public key in the DOM
- Use port to communicate from content to background (should be faster). At least to decrypt the links;
- Use chrome.i18n to implement i18n
- Remove unused module deps from content script
