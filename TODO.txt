content
==================================
- Provide a key shortcut to auto-encrypt current text with the last public key (or combination of public keys).
- Ask for password. When codes are detected, open a dialog to ask to unlock the private key. The dialog should have a "remember for 24 hours" checkbox. It should also have an OK and Cancel buttons. If the user has not set up a public key, the dialog should nag about setting up one.
- Unify the way [PGP MESSAGE:1234] is displayed. Maybe move it in a method in messageStore
- Recognize public key links and transform them into a clickable item. When clicked, import into the address book and show an info notif.
- Make notifs slide down to open and slide up to close.
- Test notifs in Slack. Make sure their z-index is right.
- Once a text area has been encrypted, mark it as such, so it can not be double-encrypted.
