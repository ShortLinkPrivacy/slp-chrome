general
==================================
- think about a more general SLP url scheme, so it can scale with other urls

immediate
==================================
- it seems that the background page disconnects after a while, causing lost connection with content
    - Try using an event page (non-presistent background) that saves the privateKey password in localstore
- the slp.li page should also decrypt (for those who use mail clients and click the link)
- pass more events to the window (from the content page), so page in slp.li can react

browser
==================================
- show "verifying ..." when the private key is being unlocked
- pasting the public key should not replace the text, but add to it instead

content
==================================
- Command-Option-L should show a message if no last recepient

background
==================================
- decide what to do with the cached public key link

settings
====================================
- need to import and export secret key and address book


installation
====================================


Development
====================================
- Continue internationalizing with chrome.i18n

Testing
===================================
